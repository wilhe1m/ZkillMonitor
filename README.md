# ZkillMonitor
Monitors zkill for killmails and the flashes led when some come in.

This is a simple pice of code that attaches to zkill using a filter flashes a light if kills are made that pass the filter entered. This is used to light up a sweet sculpture.

Targets rasperry pi w zero, this means that for all intents and purposes there is no sound and thus we cannot play a taylor swift song every time.

If you have screen installed you can use start.sh to run this in the background. That means you could do other stuff with your pi too (if you wanted).
